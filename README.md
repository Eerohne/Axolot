# How to use?

First, clone the project into your personnal computer. Next, open it with an IDE of your choice using the build.gradle file.

When that is done, just build and run the project!

Once you are inside the project, you can see a few different window: a CPU window, a control window, a memory window, and a terminal window.

The CPU window allows a real-time access to the registry of the computer.

The control window allows to load programs to the computer, as well as to pause, run, and stop the CPU clock.

The memory window allows the access to all addresses in the memory at any time. You can modify the values of the element in the array yourself, and see the values of each address change as a program continues running.

Finally, the terminal is an output window for the loaded program: if needed, the program can display text to the terminal.
