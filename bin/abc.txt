;this program displays the alphabet on the terminal
;the program loops through all ascii codes of the letters and stores them sequentially in memory
;we them point

lda , 90 	; Loads 90 into A (ascii value of Z)
ldx , 25 	; Loads 25 into X (the offset inside memory)

sta x $0100

:loop ;now loop through every letter and store in memory using x as an offset
dec
dex
bng # endLoop ;stop if x has underflown (26 loops have passed, all characters are generated)
sta x $0100
jmp # loop

:endLoop ;now point the terminal to
lda , 01
sta # $fe01
lda , 00
sta # $fe02
lda , 01
sta # $fe00
